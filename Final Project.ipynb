    "Reading and watching stories unfold is a past time that many people enjoy. People tend to enjoy gathering and discussing these stories that they are fan of. Every once in a while someone will come up Fanfic, spin off stories of their fandom, and share their stories with others. These stories tend to discuss their favorite pairing of characters or which pating that they wish would come to fruition, which is known as 'shipping' or 'ships'. It is intresting to see how the ships shift or are embraced as the initial story develops further. One of the biggest fandoms that are in the Anime scene right now is *My Hero Academia/Boku no Hero Academia.*"

    "There are several ethical data concerns that need to be considered for our project. Firstly web-scraping can be illegal. We checked the website's terms, Wikipedia and Archive of Our Own, and they do not mention web-scraping, but there are a multitude of examples and walk-throughs to web-scrape from these websites and neither offer separate API's to web-scrape. Secondly, we have to consider the privacy of the users writing the fanfictions and ensure we are protecting their privacy. Any identifiable personal information will be made anonymous if we scrape it, such as usernames. Thirdly, we must make sure we only use this data for our project as outlined and that we don't use it for any other purpose. Lastly, the results of our analysis must be presented in a way that does not harm any individuals or communities from the *My Hero Academia* fanbase or authors, such as perpetuating harmful stereotypes or biases. We will do this by analyzing the data objectively and any conclusions we make are drawn based solely on the data and not on preconceived notions or biases. "
